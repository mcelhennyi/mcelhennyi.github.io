Hi, I am Ian McElhenny. I am a software/hardware engineer located in the Great State of Texas. I like to push the limits of my comfort zone with learning new skills and doing new projects. Across my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOd3F3PCg3re78-pYsdSYXA) and github you can find all sorts of projects!
